# Multi-project builder for jamesli.io

Using some configuration options in config.json, build.py will clone a bunch of git projects, build them, and mount them
on subdirectories of my website. The contents of the main source directory will be used as the index.

## Setting up

The build command should be `python build.py`, requiring python 3.7.

With the current `config.json` setup, the build output folder is `public`.

## `config.json` description

`outputPath` is the path to the directory with the built website

`workingPath` is the path to a directory that will be made as a scratchpad for the builder to work

`projects` is a list of project objects, with the following properties:

`projects[0].serves` is the path the given project will be served on from the website. Eg: `/` or`/my-project`

`projects[0].source` is the path to a directory or url to a git project with the source of the project.

`projects[0].buildCommands` is a list of terminal commands that will be run in the source of the project, as strings.
Eg: `["npm install", "npm run build"]`

`projects[0].buildOutput` is the folder of the eventually built project that will be copied into whereever it's served in the output.

The `serves` and `source` properties are required. A project can either have none of the build properties or all of them.
If no build properties are specified, relative paths in HTML files (CSS link tags and JS script tags) will be fixed to be
rooted by the serves tag.
